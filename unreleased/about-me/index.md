My name is **Huan Li**, _longaspire_ is my nickname, you can just call me _**Steven**_ directly, as many of my friends do. This is my personal blog, a place where I publish my thoughts, free ideas and recent situation. It is always my pleasure to be your sincerely friend and inspire each other.

I was born in Nancheng (Jiangxi, China) on September 2, 1991\. Nowadays I am an PhD student at Department of Computer Science of Zhejiang University. My research interests are indoor localization and data management techniques. Now I am working as a Reserach Assistant at Aalborg University, Denmark.

Apart from these issues related to computer, I am a lover of sports, particularly soccer. AC Milan and Filippo Inzaghi are my favourite. I also enjoy traveling and spending time with my family and friends.
